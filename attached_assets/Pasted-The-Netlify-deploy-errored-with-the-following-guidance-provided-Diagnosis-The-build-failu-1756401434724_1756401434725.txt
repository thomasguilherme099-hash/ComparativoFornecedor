The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to the build script returning a non-zero exit code:

```
npm warn exec The following package was not found and will be installed: vite@6.3.5
Failed during stage 'building site': Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2}
```

**Solution:**
1. The error indicates that the package 'vite@6.3.5' was not found.
2. To resolve this issue, you need to verify that the package 'vite@6.3.5' is added to the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.
3. If the package is missing, you should add it to the `dependencies` in the `package.json` file.
4. After verifying the package is present, you can re-run the build to ensure it completes successfully.
