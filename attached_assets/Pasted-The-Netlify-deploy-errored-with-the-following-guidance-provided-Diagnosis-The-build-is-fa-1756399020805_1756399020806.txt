The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build is failing due to an error loading the configuration file `vite.config.prod.js` during the build process.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `vite.config.prod.js` file exists in the correct location in your repository and that it is committed to the repository.
2. If the file is missing, ensure it is added to the repository.
3. If `vite.config.prod.js` is verified to be present, check the path and make sure it is correctly referenced in the build configuration.
4. Fix any path issues or file naming discrepancies to ensure the configuration file can be loaded successfully during the build process.
