The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is occurring due to a non-zero exit code being returned at the 'building site' stage of the build process. Specifically, this error is related to the build command `npm ci && npx vite build --config vite.config.prod.js`.

**Solution:**
1. **Node Version Mismatch:**
   - The log shows that the build is attempting to download and install Node version 20.19.4, which is non-existent (e.g., there is no Node.js version 20). This mismatch in Node version is likely causing the build failure.
   - **Solution:** Update the Node version referenced in the build configuration file to a valid and existing version. Ensure that the correct Node version is specified in the `netlify.toml` or in the project's configuration files.

2. **Build Command Issue:**
   - The build command may have issues that are triggering the non-zero exit code.
   - **Solution:** 
     - Check the command `npm ci && npx vite build --config vite.config.prod.js` for any typos, missing dependencies, or incorrect configurations.
     - Run the build command locally to see if it executes without errors.

3. **Dependency Installation:**
   - It's essential to ensure all project dependencies are correctly set up.
   - **Solution:** 
     - Verify that all necessary dependencies are specified in the `package.json` file.
     - Run `npm install` locally to ensure all dependencies are installed properly.

4. **Node Version Correction:**
   - If needed, you can refer to the Netlify documentation on how to [manage Node.js and JavaScript versions](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript) for your project in case you need to adjust the Node version.

In cases where the Node version mismatch persists, updating the Node version as per the project's requirements should resolve the issue.
