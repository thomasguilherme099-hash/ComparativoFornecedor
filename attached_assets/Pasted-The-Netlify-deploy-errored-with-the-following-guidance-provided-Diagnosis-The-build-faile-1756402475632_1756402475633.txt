The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed with the error message `sh: 1: vite: not found` at [line 76](#L76), indicating that the Vite command is not found during the build.

**Solution:**
1. Make sure to add Vite as a dependency in the `package.json` file by running:
   ```
   npm install vite --save-dev
   ```
2. Verify that `vite` is listed in the `devDependencies` section of the `package.json` file.
3. If `vite` is already in the `devDependencies`, ensure that it's committed to the repository.
4. After adding Vite as a dependency, trigger a new build to see if the issue is resolved.
