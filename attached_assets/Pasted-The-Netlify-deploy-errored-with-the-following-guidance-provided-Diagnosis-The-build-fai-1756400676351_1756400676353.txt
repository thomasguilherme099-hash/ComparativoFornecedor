The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
- The build failed with the error message `Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'vite' imported from vite.config.prod.js` at [line 76](#L76).

**Solution:**
- The error occurs because the build cannot find the 'vite' package specified in the 'vite.config.prod.js' configuration file.
- To resolve this issue, ensure that the 'vite' package is added as a dependency in the 'package.json' file or commit the 'vite' package to the repository.
- Verify that the 'vite' package is included in the 'package.json' file, and if not, add it as a dependency by running `npm install vite` locally and committing the changes to the repository.
