The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is occurring with the following error message: "Failed during stage 'building site': Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2" [#L57](#L57).

**Solution:**
1. The build is failing due to a non-zero exit code, which indicates an issue with the build script.
2. To resolve this error, you should review the custom build command specified in the `netlify.toml` file at path `netlify.toml` in the root of the project directory.
3. Check the `npm ci && npx vite build --config vite.config.prod.js` command to ensure it is correctly configured and does not contain any errors or typos.
4. Verify that all the necessary dependencies for Vite are correctly set up in the project.
5. If the issue persists, you may need to troubleshoot the Vite build command locally to identify and fix any issues before deploying on Netlify.
