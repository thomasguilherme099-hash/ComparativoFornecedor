The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build is failing because it is trying to download and install Node version 20.19.4, which is an invalid or non-existent version.

**Solution:**
1. **Node Version Mismatch:**
   - The Node version being installed (`v20.19.4`) is incorrect. Node versions follow a different numbering pattern (major.minor.patch) and `20.19.4` doesn't exist.
   - Refer to the [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript) on managing Node versions for guidance on how to specify the correct Node version in your project.

2. **Updating Node Version:**
   - Check your project's `package.json` file to see which Node version is specified in the `engines` field or the `node` field.
   - Update or correct the specified Node version to a valid one. For example, `"node": "14.x"` or `"engines": { "node": "14.x"}`.
   - Make sure the corrected Node version is supported by Netlify and the dependencies used in your project.

3. **Reconfigure the Build:**
   - Once you have corrected the Node version in your project, trigger a new build to ensure the correction takes effect.
   - If needed, update the build settings in your Netlify configuration to reflect the corrected Node version for future builds.
