The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build is failing with a non-zero exit code during the stage of building the site.

The error is likely related to the build command that includes `npm ci && npx vite build --config vite.config.prod.js`.

### Solution
1. Verify that all the necessary dependencies for the build are correctly specified in the `package.json` file and committed to the repository.
2. Check if the `vite.config.prod.js` file is available in the repository.
3. Ensure that the build command is correct and there are no typos or mistakes in the command.
4. If there are no issues with dependencies or the configuration files, investigate the specific error code `2` to understand the exact cause of the failure and resolve it accordingly.
