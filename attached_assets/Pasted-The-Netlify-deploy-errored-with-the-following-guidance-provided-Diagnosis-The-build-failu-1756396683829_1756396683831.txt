The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is caused by the inability to find the 'vite' package, leading to an error during the build process.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the 'vite' package is included in the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.
2. Since the 'vite' package is not found, add 'vite@6.3.5' to the dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install vite@6.3.5
   ```
3. Ensure that the 'vite.config.ts' file is correctly configured and accessible to resolve the package. 

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the build failure related to the missing 'vite' package.
