The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed at line 66 due to the build script returning a non-zero exit code.

**Solution:**
1. Check the logs or the build script for any specific error messages that might indicate what caused the non-zero exit code.
2. Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed and configured for the build script to run successfully.
3. Verify that the build script 'npm ci && REPL_ID='' NODE_ENV=production npx vite build' is correct and doesn't contain any errors.
4. Test the build script locally to see if it runs without issues.
5. If the build script relies on any external packages or files, ensure those dependencies are added to the project. If needed, update the `package.json` or make sure all necessary files are committed to the repository.
6. If the issue persists, consider debugging the build script or seeking help from the community or the tool's documentation for further assistance.
