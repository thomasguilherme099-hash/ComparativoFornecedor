The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is due to an error loading the Vite configuration file (`vite.netlify.config.mjs`) because the package 'vite' is not found.

The relevant error lines in the log are:
- [line 74](#L74): `npm warn exec The following package was not found and will be installed: vite@6.3.5`
- [line 75](#L75): `failed to load config from /opt/build/repo/vite.netlify.config.mjs`
- [line 77](#L77): `Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'vite' imported from /opt/build/repo/node_modules/.vite-temp/vite.netlify.conf`

### Solution
1. Ensure that the 'vite' package is listed in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` of the `package.json` file.
2. Commit the changes to the repo if you have added the 'vite' package.
3. If 'vite' is a development dependency, it should be installed using `npm install vite --save-dev`.
4. If 'vite' is a regular dependency, it should be installed using `npm install vite`.
5. If 'vite' is an external package that should not be bundled, verify the package is in `package.json` or was committed to the repo before adding it to the external configuration.

Once the 'vite' package is correctly installed and available, the build should be able to locate the package and proceed with the build process.
