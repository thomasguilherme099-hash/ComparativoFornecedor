The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed with a non-zero exit code due to an issue during the stage of building the site.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that all necessary dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file and were committed to the repository.
2. Check for any build scripts in the `package.json` file that might be causing the error.
3. Review the build configuration and ensure it is correctly set up to build the site.
4. Investigate the specific error indicated by the non-zero exit code to pinpoint the exact cause of the build failure and make necessary adjustments in the build script or configuration.
