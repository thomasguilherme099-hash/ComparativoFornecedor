The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
- The build failed because Vite requires Node.js version 20.19+ or 22.12+, but the current Node.js version is 18.19.0.
- There is also an error related to the 'vite' package not being found.

**Solution:**
1. **Update Node.js version:**
   - Upgrade the Node.js version to at least 20.19.0 or 22.12.0. 
   - You can follow the documentation [here](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript) to change Node versions.

2. **Resolve 'vite' package issue:**
   - Ensure that the 'vite' package is listed in your `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.
   - Additionally, you might need to add 'vite' to the external configuration if necessary.

By updating the Node.js version and verifying the 'vite' package, you should be able to resolve the build failure.
