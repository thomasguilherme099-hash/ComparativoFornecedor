The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is due to the command `vite build` failing with the error `sh: 1: vite: not found` at [line 67](#L67).

### Solution
1. The error indicates that `vite` is not found, which suggests that Vite is not installed or available in the project dependencies.
2. To resolve this issue, ensure that Vite is listed as a dependency in the project's `package.json` file by running:
   ```bash
   npm install vite --save-dev
   ```
3. Once Vite is installed, you can run the build command successfully.
