The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is due to the inability to load the Vite configuration file during the build process.

### Solution
1. **Verify Vite Package**: Ensure that the `vite` package with version `7.1.3` or the version specified in the `vite.config.ts` file is included in the `package.json` file or has been committed to the repository.

2. **Fix Vite Configuration**: As the build failed to load the configuration from `vite.config.ts`, you may need to check the contents of this file for any errors. Additionally, if the Vite configuration is not in TypeScript, you might need to rename it to `vite.config.js`.

By addressing these issues, you should be able to resolve the build failure.
