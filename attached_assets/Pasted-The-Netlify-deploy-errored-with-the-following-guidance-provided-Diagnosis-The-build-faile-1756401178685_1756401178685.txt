The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to an error related to a missing package 'vite' during the build process. The error specifically states: "Cannot find package 'vite' imported from vite.config.ts".

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the 'vite' package is included in the `package.json` file of your project. If it's missing, you need to add it as a dependency by running:
   ```bash
   npm install vite@6.3.5 --save-dev
   ```
2. If the 'vite' package is already in the `package.json`, ensure that the package was committed to the repository. If it wasn't, commit the changes and trigger the build process again.

By ensuring that the 'vite' package is in the `package.json` file and committed to the repository, you should be able to resolve the "Cannot find package 'vite'" error during the build process.
