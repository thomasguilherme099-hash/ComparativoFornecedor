The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is due to a non-zero exit code returned during the site building stage.

### Solution
1. **Verify Node Version**: The build is attempting to download and install Node version 20.19.4, which is not a valid Node.js version. Node.js versions follow a different numbering scheme. Ensure that a correct Node.js version is used.  
   For managing Node versions in Netlify, refer to the documentation on [changing Node versions](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript).

2. **Install Missing Package**: The build warns about a missing package `vite@7.1.3`. Verify that this package is listed in the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository. If it's missing, add it to the dependencies in the `package.json` file.

In summary, correct the Node.js version being used and ensure that the `vite@7.1.3` package is included in the project dependencies.
